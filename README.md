# React setup test

## Setup
How to get the project up and running after cloning the repository

Start the server
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Access the site within a browser using the url provided. (eg. http://127.0.0.1:8000/)


In a different terminal
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

You may have to refresh the original browser window, although any changes made to the code should be reflected in the browser
